Used Car Price Prediction: Key Findings and Recommendations for Dealers
Introduction
This report summarizes an analysis of used car prices based on vehicle characteristics such as age, mileage, manufacturer, condition, and other factors. The goal is to help you, as used car dealers, better understand which vehicles hold value and how to optimize your inventory to meet customer demand and maximize profits.

Key Findings
1. Price Distribution and Outliers
Most used cars are priced under $30,000.

There are a few expensive outliers, with prices reaching up to $100,000, usually luxury or rare models.

Some listings with very low prices (e.g., $0 or $1) likely indicate data errors or missing price information and should be treated carefully.

2. Age and Mileage Strongly Influence Price
Newer cars (models from 2015 onward) tend to be priced higher.

There is a clear negative relationship between mileage and price: cars with fewer miles generally command better prices.

The correlation between mileage and price is moderately strong (around -0.47), meaning mileage is an important factor in valuing a vehicle.

Similarly, the year of the car has a moderate positive correlation (about 0.44) with price.

3. Vehicle Condition Matters
Cars listed as "new" or "like new" have the highest median prices.

Vehicles in "fair" or "salvage" condition are significantly cheaper.

This confirms that condition is a key driver of price and customer interest.

4. Transmission and Manufacturer Effects
Cars with automatic transmission usually have a price premium.

Brands like Toyota and Honda tend to retain value better, making them attractive for inventory.

5. Model Performance Summary
Using different machine learning models to predict car prices:

Random Forest regression performed best, explaining about 77% of the price variation with the lowest prediction error.

Simpler linear models like Ridge and Lasso also provide useful baseline predictions but are less accurate.

Recommendations for Inventory Strategy
Focus on newer vehicles:

Prioritize cars less than 5 years old, as they tend to sell at higher prices and attract more buyers.

Mileage threshold:

Stock vehicles with under 100,000 miles to appeal to customers looking for reliability and value.

Emphasize condition:

Invest in vehicles in good or better condition; avoid or carefully price cars with poor or salvage titles.

Prioritize popular brands:

Toyota and Honda models generally hold value better and attract steady demand.

Transmission preferences:

Automatic transmission vehicles command a price premium and are often preferred by a wider customer base.

Conclusion
By carefully selecting vehicles that are newer, have lower mileage, are in good condition, and come from reputable manufacturers, dealers can optimize their inventory for better sales performance and profitability. Leveraging these insights can help dealers fine-tune their purchasing decisions and pricing strategies in a competitive market.
